ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m a recent Technical College graduate with a certificate in Software Development.

I also worked as a part-time work-study for their Software Development program for a period of 6 months.
In the position, I contributed directly to the writing, development, testing, and of the curriculum materials used to teach both foundational and advanced programming. 

Through the role, I took part in several hands-on, high-impact projects, including:

1. VEX Robotics Curriculum â€“ Led the design and launch of a robotics module introducing students to programming through real-world, interactive robotics using the VEX EXP platform.

2. Structured Projects â€“ Helped refine advanced coursework where students build a fully functional e-commerce storefront, covering both front-end and back-end development.

3. Dual Keyboard Typing Game â€“ Designed and developed a fast-paced, two-player typing game used by the collegeâ€™s outreach team to engage prospective students and promote programming in a fun, interactive way.

4. Capstone Project â€“ Developed a cross-platform .NET MAUI application for Android and PC that teaches users musical chords and intervals, featuring a built-in live audio tuner for real-time pitch recognition.

5. Data Analyst Curriculum â€“ Assisted in the creation and review of the new Data Analyst program, ensuring that the course content aligns with industry standards and is approachable for learners.

Currently Working on:

1. Learning C++

2. SpoilerTracker (In Development) â€“ Building a custom software tool that acts as a translation layer between generated YAML-like log files from Ocarina of Time and Majoraâ€™s Mask Randomizers and EmoTracker. This tool parses and reformats spoiler logs to json seamlessly integrate with the tracking software, enhancing usability and streamlining the gameplay experience for randomizer players.
