Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Certificate in Software Development at OTECH, where I also work as a part-time work-study for the Software Development program. A role Iâ€™ve held for the past 6 months.

In this position, I contribute directly to the development, testing, and refinement of curriculum materials used to teach foundational and advanced programming concepts. Through this role, Iâ€™ve taken part in several hands-on, high-impact projects, including:

1. VEX Robotics Curriculum â€“ Led the design and launch of a robotics module introducing students to programming through real-world, interactive robotics using the VEX platform.

2. Structured Projects â€“ Helped refine advanced coursework where students build a fully functional e-commerce storefront, covering both front-end and back-end development.

3. Dual Keyboard Typing Game â€“ Designed and developed a fast-paced, two-player typing game used by OTECHâ€™s outreach team to engage prospective students and promote programming in a fun, interactive way.

4. Capstone Project â€“ Developed a cross-platform .NET MAUI application for Android and PC that teaches users musical chords and intervals, featuring a built-in live audio tuner for real-time pitch recognition.

5. Data Analyst Curriculum (In Development) â€“ Currently assisting in the creation and review of the new Data Analyst program, ensuring that the course content aligns with industry standards and is approachable for learners.

6. SpoilerTracker (In Development) â€“ Building a custom software tool that acts as a translation layer between generated YAML-like log files from Ocarina of Time and Majoraâ€™s Mask Randomizers and EmoTracker.
